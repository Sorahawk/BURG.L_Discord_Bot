# About The Project

The BURG.L Discord Bot is a resource manager that aids [Grounded](https://grounded.obsidian.net/) players by tracking requirements and allocating tasks. BURG.L pulls data from the [Grounded Wiki](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Grounded_Wiki) to get information for items, such as crafting costs. Despite the recent introduction of slash commands by Discord, prefix commands are still used in this project as Discord's in-game overlay does not work with slash commands.


## Planned Features

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Object Search | Retrieves object information (e.g. creatures, items, resources, status effects, mutations) |
| Creature Card Search | Retrieves a creature's bestiary card |
| Chopping List | Consolidates total number of resources required for crafting and building. |
| Task Scheduler | Keeps track of user-inputted tasks, as well as generating harvesting tasks based on the Chopping List |
